# vue-data-table
This project https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ is a vue project that displays data from API endpoints in a table structure. VDataTable and VDialog components were created in the project. No ready-made UI library was used for the UI.

# Issues
* Sorting table data
* Making the VDialog component public currently functions to update the VDialog component to-do list.
* Adding loading to the table
* Displaying transaction successful or unsuccessful feedback to the user
